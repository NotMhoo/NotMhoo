# Hi, I'm Ammar!

Welcome to my GitHub repository, the central hub where I consolidate all my personal projects. By profession, I'm a Voice Engineer. However, my tech journey doesn't end there. I'm deeply fascinated by the realms of Cybersecurity and Automation. As I continue to explore and grow in these domains, this space serves as a testament to my learning and achievements. Feel free to browse through, provide feedback, or collaborate. Let's learn and grow together!
